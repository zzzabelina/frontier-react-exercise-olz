# Frontier React Exercise Thoughts

Hello Frontier Team!

I was optimistic about timings for the exercise. Though I can't say exact timing, I would say that with all preparations and stuff it took me not less than 6 hours to finish to the point which you can see.

Generally, I liked exercise it is not trivial and differs from what I am doing in my day to day life.

I haven't done any test tasks for eight long years and spend some spare time for this task so to have some feedback will be awesome.

Have a good weekend,

Cheers,

Olga :)
